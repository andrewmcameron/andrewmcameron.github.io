<div class="text2">
[Colima Warbler](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/colima-warbler) (*Leiothlypis crissalis*) is a migratory songbird whose breeding habitat is limited to parts of the rugged, mountainous terrain of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental and the Chisos Mountains of Big Bend National Park.
Range maps for this species tend to significantly overstate its extant distribution within the United States.
To get a sense of species' 'official' range, check out the map I created below, based on the distributions recognized by the United States Geological Survey and BirdLife International.

Breeding birds have been shown to inhabit areas dominated by oak, pinyon, juniper, and Arizona cypress, and demonstrate a clear preference for elevations above 1,500 m, with individuals most frequently observed at elevations ≥ 1,800 m.
They employ a ground-nesting strategy and prefers steep (≥35°), north-facing slopes, and sites that are shaded from direct sunlight for 70% of daylight hours.

I used these attributes to derive a model of probable species distribution within the US that radically reduces the area of likely occurrence as compared with the official USGS species range polygon. The project primarily involved raster analysis: deriving slope and aspect from digital elevation models, extracting raster cells based on specified attributes and mask polygons, reclassifying cells to standardized values, and overlaying raster layers to calculte the sum of their cells.

## urban gun crime

### aggregating gun crime incidents to reveal spatial patterns
:::
<div class="text2">
A significant part of my time working as an intern with the City of Newport News GIS team involved processing, geocoding, mapping, and analyzing five years (2018-2022) worth of gun crime data as part of the city's Gun Violence Intervention Program.

Given the size and complexity of the gun crime data received from the Newport News Police Department, a lot of wrangling was required to prepare the data to be mapped and analyzed. Because this project was carried out with the intention of being able to re-run the analysis in the future with new data, I developed a [script in R](linktoscript) to streamline the data preprocessing tasks.
This automation not only streamlined the initial data preparation but also ensured the project's adaptability and longevity.
Once prepared, I utilized ArcGIS Pro for geocoding, mapping, and subsequent analysis.

A variety of analyses and visualization techniques were employed to better understand the spatial patterns underlying gun crime in the city, each of which were presented to city officials, decision makers and community leaders in the fall of 2023.

-   **Bivariate Choropleth** (Population Density vs. Incident Rate): This map combines two key variables—population density and gun crime incident rate—into a single visualization.
    By doing so, it indicates how the frequency of gun crimes correlates with the concentration of people across different areas.

-   **Hotspots**: This visualization identifies geographical areas with significantly higher occurrences of gun crimes by aggregating points into hexagonal bins 1,000 ft. across.

-   **Hot Streets**: Similar to the hotspots map but more specific.
    This map pinpoints street segments with high frequencies of gun crime.

-   **Victim Binning**: This map displays the spatial distribution of gun crime victims, with victims aggregated into 1,000 x 1,000 foot cells.
    It focuses exclusively on individuals directly affected by gun crime incidents, explicitly excluding victim categories such as 'Business' and 'Government' from the analysis.
    I employed a threshold to enhance clarity and focus, where only cells containing two or more victims are visualized.

I found the hot streets analysis especially insightful.
By combining the derived gun crime point layer with the city's street centerline layer, I was able to identify street segments with the highest density of gun crime incidents by assigning each point to the nearest feature.

The result?
Of nearly 10,000 street segments that comprise Newport News’ road network fully *80%* of gun crime incidents occurred on just over 9% of those segments.
More than a quarter of all incidents took place on fewer than 1% of all segments.
This analysis helped to highlight the spatial concentration of gun crime incidents in the city, and to identify areas where the city's resources might be most effectively deployed

<div class="text2">
In this project, I carried out an analysis to produce a habitat suitability index (HSI) aimed at identifying potential saltmarsh sparrow winter habitat in southeast Virginia - effectively the southern most extent of their winter range - in areas not already protected under a biodiversity or conservation mandate.

Confronted with the combined effects of sea-level rise and human coastline modification, the saltmarsh sparrow’s continued survival is by no means guaranteed.
The North American Bird Conservation Initiative's [2022 'State of the Birds' report](https://www.stateofthebirds.org/2022/) estimates that the species' population has declined by more than *half* since 1970.
The report anticipates a further 50% decline over the next half century.
Similarly, researchers have demonstrated a staggering 9% annual rate of population decline since the mid-1990s.
If that trend continues, they predict a collapse of the global population within 50 years, with as few as 500 individuals left by mid-century.

</div>

These birds demonstrate a strong affinity for high marsh vegetation.
Research on migratory songbirds has demonstrated that occupying inadequate wintering habitat can affect the physical condition of birds during migration, their arrival date on nesting grounds, and their condition at breeding sites.
Working to ensure access to high marsh throughout the entirety of the species’ range is therefore critical.

Generating the HSI required integrating vector and raster data from multiple sources, including the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS), eBird (Cornell Lab of Ornithology), the Protected Area Database (PAD), and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).

## bird diversity in grassland vs forest ecosystems

### class-level landscape metrics as predictors of avian species richness
:::
<div class="text2">
For this analysis, completed as my final project for landscape ecology (ENVS 591) during the fall of 2023 at VCU, I was interested in exploring the extent to which class-level landscape metrics differ in their ability to explain variation in avian species richness (total \# of different species) in grassland ecosystems versus forest ecosystems.

The whole project was carried out using **R** in RStudio, and was a great opportunity to learn how to conduct a spatial analysis outside of a point-and-click GIS environment. Working outside of ArcGIS Pro - and therefore not enjoying the convenience of 'on-the-fly projection' - required me to be especially attentive to coordinate reference systems and projections as I prepared spatial data from different sources for analysis.
I also became familiar with a number of great spatial R packages and APIs, including `mapview`, `terra`, `sf`, `raster`, `FedData`, and `landscapemetrics`.

This project gave me a chance to work with data sets from the National Ecology Observatory Network (NEON), a comprehensive ecological monitoring program that collects standardized, high-quality data from diverse ecosystems across the United States.
Check out the maps below - which I made in R using the `mapview` package - to see the NEON sites used in my analysis.

My analysis used three years of data (2019-2021) from three separate study areas in each of the two landscape types.
Study areas comprised 10-20 distinct study plots, with each 'plot-year' combination representing a unique sampling event (n=228).
For each plot-year combination, I calculated the total number of bird species observed.
I pulled in National Land Cover Data using `FedData` and generated buffers around each plot-year at 200m, 500m, 1000m, and 2000m in order to assess the influence of landscape metrics at different spatial scales.

Before calculating landscape metrics I first reclassified the NLCD data using a reclassification matrix to produce new raster datasets with simplified land cover categories (forest, agricultural, and urban).
I then used the `landscapemetrics` package to calculate 5 class-level metrics for each buffer size:

  <img src="media/le_flow.png" style="border:1px solid #8896AB; width:675px;">
</div>


Five landscape metrics across four buffer sizes produced a total of 20 variables to be considered as potential predictors of species richness in each ecosystem type. Given time constraints, I took a bit of a shortcut to select variables for modelling. I utilized a tiered hierarchical approach by applying the `corSelect()` function from the `fuzzySim` package (v. 4.10.5). Minimally correlated variables were first selected at each spatial extent and those selected variables were then further evaluated together to make a final selection. The approach was pragmatic, but I would like to eventually return to this analysis and tailor variable selection by better integrating domain-specific ecological knowledge.

With variables selected, I applied a generalized linear mixed model approach to incorporate *study* area as a random effect. This produced a 'singular fit', however, indicating that the model was overfitted -- that is, the random effects structure was too complex to be supported by the data. Instead, I utilized multiple regression to fit models for every possible combination of predictor variable, then compared models using AIC to select the top performers and identify the most important predictors. 

<b>tl;dr version</b> 

* In mid-Atlantic forests, only elevation and % forest cover were found to be significant predictors of avian species richness. 
* In grasslands, both PLAND at 1000m and AI at 1000m were found to be significant predictors.
* A significantly higher amount of variation in avian species richness was explained by grassland model (42.6%) than forest models (<12%).

Here's a <b>[PDF version of a presentation](portfolio/le_final.pdf)</b> I gave where you can take a more detailed look at some of the results.
